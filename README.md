# Telemetry-Prototype
An arduino telemetry data collector prototype for a racecar

This arduino prototype is meant for use in a racecar to track throttle and 
brake trace to help a driver improve their lap time.

This project uses 2 potentiometers to track the movements of the pedals in the car
using 3d printed components to mount to the cockpit.

The project tracks the data and uploads this in CSV format to an SD card module ready
for reading inbetween on track sessions.

I created this for my own personal racing ventures as an initial proof of concept before 
manufacturing 3d printed parts and permanently mounting the system in the car. This 
system was created on a budget and meant to compete with other systems such as the AIM data
tracker and Racebox products, as these were out of my price range.

Overall, the system is near completion with a few more CAD designs needed alongside
installation within the car. The software and hardware have been completed and proved to work.

See the given CAD files, Images and Arduino coding in this repository for all the details.

Thanks for checking this project out.
